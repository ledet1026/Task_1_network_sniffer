##  Description

This project is part of the **CodeAlpha Cybersecurity Internship (July 2025).
I built a ""network packet sniffer"" using Python's `socket` module with raw sockets.

The sniffer captures and displays Ethernet, IP, ICMP, TCP, and UDP packets in real-time.

##  Features

- Raw socket programming in Python
- Real-time packet sniffing
- Protocol filtering (ICMP, TCP, UDP, All)
- Header parsing for IP, TCP, UDP, and ICMP packets
- Custom console output formatting


##  How to Run

 Must run with 'sudo' (admin access required for raw sockets)

```bash
sudo python3 packet_sniffer_raw_socket.py
